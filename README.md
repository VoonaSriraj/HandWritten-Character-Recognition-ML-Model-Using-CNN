# HandWritten-Character-Recognition-ML-Model-Using-CNN
The machine learning model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for handwritten character recognition. It accepts input images of size 28x28 pixels in grayscale and outputs predictions across 26 alphabet categories (Aâ€“Z). The architecture combines convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling layers for spatial reduction, and fully connected layers for classification. ReLU activation ensures non-linearity, while softmax generates probability distributions over classes. Data preprocessing includes reshaping, normalization (scaling pixel values), and one-hot encoding of labels. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss, with accuracy as the primary metric, ensuring robust generalization on test datasets.
